# Peek

**Peek** is a local-first API exploration tool built for the terminal. It aims to make testing and chaining API requests simple, fast, and versionable.

It doesnâ€™t do much yet.

## Goals

- Define and run request groups from local YAML or TOML files
- Support variable injection via environment, prompts, and response chaining
- Provide redaction rules for sensitive fields
- Execute HTTP, and eventually gRPC and WebSocket requests
- Keep everything local and Git-friendly

Stay tuned.
